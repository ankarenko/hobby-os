	The bootloader has loaded us into 32-bit protected mode on a x86

	control of the CPU. The kernel can only make use of hardware features
	and any code it provides as part of itself. There's no printf
	function, unless the kernel provides its own <stdio.h> header and a
	printf implementation. There are no security restrictions, no
	safeguards, no debugging mechanisms, only what the kernel provides
	itself. It has absolute and complete power over the
	machine.
